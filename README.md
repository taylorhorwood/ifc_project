# IFC Project Management App

## Introduction
This is a study into the IFC project management classes.
I frequently create different project management schemas for job tracking and 
other projects that I am involved with in construction. I am also intrested in 
native IFC for construction. 

I'm studying the IFC class in Django to see if there is a use for defining all
my projects in a IFC compatible format for future interoperability.

I'm also writing out the class structure manually so I actual read the docs and
because I'm attempting to use Neovim in my everyday workflow. I want to use
this project as play ground for both.
